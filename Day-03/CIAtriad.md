## CIA TRIAD
### CONFIDENTIALITY
This principle ensures that sensitive data is accessed only by authorised users, preventing unauthorised access or leaks. Techniques like encryption, access controls, and multi-factor authentication help maintain confidentiality. For example, when logging into an online banking app, a strong password plus a one-time code ensures only the account owner can access personal financial data.

### INTEGRITY
Integrity means that data remains accurate, complete, and trustworthy throughout its lifecycle. It protects against unauthorised changes or corruption, intentional or accidental. For instance, in healthcare, patient records must not be altered illicitly; digital signatures and audit logs help verify this, ensuring the information is reliable for medical decisions.

### AVAILABILITY
Availability guarantees that data and systems are accessible and operational whenever authorised users need them. This means preventing downtime caused by hardware failure, cyberattacks like DDoS, or disasters. An example is an e-commerce website using redundant servers and backups to stay online and functional even during traffic spikes or attacks.

## IMPORTANCE OF CIA TRIAD
The CIA Triad is critical as it provides a balanced framework to safeguard information by addressing its confidentiality, reliability, and accessibility. Organisations use it to build security policies, assess vulnerabilities, respond to incidents, and design resilient systems. Upholding all three pillars ensures trusted, safe, and available information, which is essential for modern digital operations and trust in technology.
