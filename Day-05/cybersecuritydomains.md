# Day 05 - Domain of Cybersecurity: roles and careers
## Topics
- Domains of cybersecrity
    - Roles under that Domain

## RED TEAM (OFFENSIVE SECURITY)
- Simulate real cyberattacks to find security weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
- Perform penetration testing, social engineering, and ethical hacking.
- Provide actionable insights to improve the organizationâ€™s defenses.

### ROLES UNDER THIS
1. Penetration Tester: Simulates attacks on systems, networks, and applications to find exploitable vulnerabilities.
2. Social Engineer: Uses psychological manipulation to test human vulnerabilities like phishing susceptibility.
3. Red Team Operator/Engineer: Executes advanced adversary-like tactics over extended engagements to test security.
5. Red Team Manager: Leads the team, plans operations, and coordinates with other security teams.

## BLUE TEAM (DEFENSIVE SECURITY)
- Monitor networks and systems for suspicious activities and potential breaches.
- Detect, respond to, and mitigate cyber threats in real-time.
- Implement security measures, conduct threat hunting, and manage incident response.

### ROLES UNDER THIS
1. Security Analyst: Monitors network traffic and system alerts to detect malicious activity.
2. Incident Responder: Investigates security breaches, contains threats, and remediates incidents.
3. Threat Hunter: Proactively searches for hidden threats or indicators of compromise in the environment.
4. Security Engineer: Implements and maintains defensive technologies like firewalls, IDS/IPS, and endpoint protection.

## PURPLE TEAM (COLLABORATION)
- Facilitate communication and collaboration between Red and Blue Teams.
- Ensure lessons learned from attacks are integrated into defense strategies.
- Drive continuous improvement in the organizationâ€™s cybersecurity posture.

### ROLES UNDER THIS
1. Purple Team Specialist: Facilitates communication between Red and Blue teams, sharing attack insights and defense strategies.
2. Security Trainer: Educates teams based on lessons from simulations and improves overall security posture.
3. Security Analyst/Engineer (Hybrid Role): Participates in both offensive and defensive activities to improve detection and response.

## ðŸ’¡KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Cybersecurity teams are essential for protecting organizations from cyber threats by implementing security, monitoring, responding to incidents, and managing risks.
- Each team member has a specific role, from executive leadership to analysts and engineers, working collaboratively to strengthen security posture.
- Effective cybersecurity depends on coordination across roles and continuous adaptation to evolving threats for robust defense and rapid response.
