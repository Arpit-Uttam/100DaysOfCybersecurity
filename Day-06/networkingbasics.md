## WHAT IS NETWORKING
Computer networking is the practice of connecting two or more computing devices—such as computers, servers, printers, or smartphones—so they can communicate and share information, resources, and services with each other.

## IP ADDRESSES
An IP address acts as a device's "home address" within a network, allowing accurate delivery of data packets by identifying both the origin and destination of information. It consists of either numerical values (IPv4) or alphanumeric characters (IPv6), and each IP address is globally or locally unique within its network scope.

## TYPES OF IP ADDRESSES
