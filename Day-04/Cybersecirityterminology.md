## THREAT
This principle ensures that sensitive data is accessed only by authorised users, preventing unauthorised access or leaks. Techniques like encryption, access controls, and multi-factor authentication help maintain confidentiality. For example, when logging into an online banking app, a strong password plus a one-time code ensures only the account owner can access personal financial data.

## VULNERAILITY
Integrity means that data remains accurate, complete, and trustworthy throughout its lifecycle. It protects against unauthorised changes or corruption, intentional or accidental. For instance, in healthcare, patient records must not be altered illicitly; digital signatures and audit logs help verify this, ensuring the information is reliable for medical decisions.
