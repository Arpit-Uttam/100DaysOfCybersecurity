# Day 04 - Common Cybersecurity Terminology

- Common Cybersecurity Terminology

## THREAT
A threat is any circumstance or eventâ€”natural or human-madeâ€”that can potentially cause harm or loss to an information system, its data, or the broader organization. Threats include malware (viruses, worms, ransomware), hackers, insider attacks, or even natural disasters. The mere existence of a threat does not mean damage will occur; it becomes dangerous when paired with a vulnerability

## VULNERAILITY
A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, software, hardware, or process that can be exploited by a threat actor. Common vulnerabilities include bugs in code, outdated software, weak passwords, open ports, or misconfigurations. Not every vulnerability results in a breachâ€”attackers must still find and exploit it successfully. Timely patching, secure coding, and configuration management help minimize vulnerabilities

## EXPLOIT
An exploit is a specific technique, tool, or piece of code that takes advantage of a vulnerability. Exploits can be custom scripts, software, or even manual methods. Once an attacker finds a vulnerability, the exploit helps them bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access, or perform malicious actions. Exploits often include a payload (malicious code to execute), but can also be used just to gather information or escalate privileges.

## PAYLOAD
The payload is the actual malicious component delivered during an exploitâ€”essentially, the code or instructions that perform harmful actions. It could be ransomware (encrypting files), spyware (stealing data), rootkits (gaining persistent control), or even simple commands that create a backdoor. While the exploit is how the attacker gets into the system, the payload determines what the attack actually does

## ZERO DAY 
A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw that is unknown to the software vendor and remains unpatched; attackers exploit it before security teams can develop or distribute a fix. The term "zero day" means there have been zero days to fix the issue before it's used in attacks. Zero-day exploits are highly sought after, often used in sophisticated attacks, and can cause significant damage because traditional security solutions canâ€™t detect them until a patch is issued. The period when a zero-day is being weaponized but not yet patched is called the "window of vulnerability.

## ðŸ’¡KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Risks arise only when a threat exploits a specific vulnerability; without a matching vulnerability or threat, there is no risk.
- Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be controlled and mitigated, while threats represent the potential harm that exploits those weaknesses.
- Understanding the relationship among threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits is crucial to managing cybersecurity risks effectively and preventing attacks.
